# OpenCV Proyects

Proyects involving OpenCV library

## Proyect List

* **Drawing**
* **Real Time Processing**

## Drawing

A couple of py script that will open your main camera, threshold a predetermined color range, and
draw with that color. When the color dissapears from screen, the script will analize the drawing
using a neural network to interpret the number/letter (Depends on the .py you use) you wrote.
 
To pick the colors there is a side script that will help you out.

## Real Time Processing

Another script that will open your main camera, and look into a predetermined ROI.
There it will apply a series of filters in order to remove the background and use
a neural network afterwards to interpret the foreground.
